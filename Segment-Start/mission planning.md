## LUNARIUM START

- Starting point: Lack of resources, operating undercover, using civilian ships + mostly human weapons, Houses Bebliss and Idriss giving the player plot armor against Heliarchs after battles, no Lunarium territory yet.

- End point: Acquired many raw materials + sizeable Heliarch fleet from Flugbu, revealed to the populace and laid about some of the Heliarch wrongdoings with evidence, developed some new tech (unlocks only two weapons for the player in this segment, though), Heliarchs bypass the plot armor and player is now a known terrorist, along with Houses Bebliss and Idriss, Remote Blue + Station Cian established as the first Lunarium strongholds.

## HELIARCH START 

- Starting point: Random raids apparently, messed up/jammed communications, they over the course think Bebliss and Idriss are kinda suspicious but can't just oust them without majorly shaking up Arach space, so need to prepare for it right, overall have a huge advantage.

- End point: They enforce a blockade for ships passing through the ringed systems, the jig is up for Bebliss and Idriss, Remote Blue and Station Cian are lost, Flugbu fleet is stolen, meaning the big Heliarch reservoir/contingency chokepoint for the Arach side of the ringworlds is lost. They still hold a huge advantage, but the Lunarium is clearly a credible threat to their regime as a whole.
