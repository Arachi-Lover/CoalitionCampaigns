# CoalitionCampaigns

The purpose of this repository is to try and make developing the Coalition campaigns, meaning the Heliarch and Lunarium campaigns, a collaborative project.

A few general statements about the plans for the planned campaigns:

- **1 - The campaigns should be rolled out in segments, similar to how the Intros were added in by their own. It is planned that each side of the campaign is composed of 5 sequential segments, with the Intro being the first;**

- **2 - The corresponding segments of the Heliarch and Lunarium sides of the campaign should be developed alongside one another, as the idea is they mirror one another in the main events that occur. The segments of both sides should also, ideally, be PR'd and merged together;**

- **3 - For either side, out of the 4 segments after the Intro (Start, Middle 1, Middle 2, End), 3 segments will contain 1 decision point (think the Free Worlds reconciliation/checkmate decision), and the sum of these will determine the endpoint scenario, and some interactions, after the end of that campaign;**

- **4 - A player will only be able to move past the Intro of the Coalition campaigns after having completed the main campaign (this means the human campaign, so the Free Worlds, Navy or Syndicate campaign). It may be the case that they are locked behind something else (such as the Wanderers campaign), but that's not yet decided.**
